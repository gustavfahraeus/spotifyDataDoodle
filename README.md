# spotifyDataDoodle ðŸŽµ

**spotifyDataDoodle** is a project I built as a way to learn about, and improve at, web development. <br/>

The purpose of spotifyDataDoodle is to show you what you have been listening to lately (at least while using Spotify). ðŸ˜Š <br/>

More specifically you can see your Top 25 most listened to artists & songs in 3 different time intervals (~4 weeks, ~6 months, as well as some years back).

The code handling the OAuth verification can be found at [spotifydatadoodle-oauth](https://github.com/gustavfahraeus/spotifydatadoodle-oauth)

# Future

I am currently building an **"expansion"** of this project! <br/>

I want to create functionality for visitors to see how their individual listening taste evolves over time, and I want visitors to be able to compare their data to other users in a variety of ways. For example: </br>
> "Show me the aggregate **Top 25 Artists (short term)** of visitors who has Frank Ocean among their Top 3, with samples taken only from visits during the last 12 weeks". <br>

The goal is to build better understanding about how to go about structuring dataflow in web applications, as well as how to maintain a database. But if enough people used the site so that the data was somewhat representative and useful, that would be cool too ðŸŒ±. <br/>


That project is being kept at [spotifyDataDoodle-expansion](https://github.com/gustavfahraeus/mySpotifyData-expansion). <br/>

This repo lives on as a little time capsule. ðŸš€ <br/>
Thanks for your time and interest!
